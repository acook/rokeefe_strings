Purpose: Reimplement the UNIX ctype(3) library.

isaneol(c) means that c is a line terminating character.
isalnum, ispunct, isspace, and isaneol are defined on the
range -1..127, i.e. on ASCII U {EOF}, while all the other
macros are defined for any integer.

isodigit(c) checks for Octal digits.
isxdigit(c) checkx for heXadecimal digits.

#define isprint(c) ((unsigned)((c)-' ') < 95)

/* The following "conversion" macros have been in some versions of UNIX
but are not in all. tocntrl is new. The original motivation for ^?
being a name for DEL was that (x)^64 mapped A..Z to ^A..^Z and also
? to DEL. The trouble is that this trick doesn't work for lower case
letters. The version given here is not mine. I wish it was. It has
the nice property that DEL is mapped to itself (so does EOF).
tolower(c) and toupper(c) are only defined when isalpha(c).
